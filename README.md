# tivJS
Validation of a unique personal identification number that is assigned to every 
citizen of Turkey. The identification number is a unique 11-digit number 
given by the MERNIS computer on the basis of the citizen's registration record 
that is kept by the registration office. The number does not reflect any 
personal information about the citizen. It is not possible to change 
the identification number once applied. 


Some web apps and projects need to verify and validate in a correct way. 
This library can helpful if anyone helps. Feel free to contribute and use.
